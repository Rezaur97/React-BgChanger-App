Project Name: Background Changer App

Description: The Background Changer App is a simple React-based project designed to help me get started with React fundamentals and explore how Tailwind CSS integrates within a React environment. The app allows users to change the background color of the webpage with a single click, demonstrating how state management and event handling work in React. Tailwind CSS is used to style the interface, providing a clean and modern look while keeping the styling process efficient and streamlined.

Key Features:

Dynamic background color changes on button clicks.
Simple and intuitive user interface.
Integration of Tailwind CSS for responsive and utility-first styling.
This project served as a learning experience for both React and Tailwind CSS and acted as an introduction to building interactive user interfaces with modern web technologies.
